# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/urlmap.git
cd urlmap

# Add the upstream repository
git remote add upstream https://github.com/aoshimash/urlmap.git
```

## üìù Making Changes

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names with prefixes:

- `feat/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Adding tests
- `ci/` - CI/CD changes

Examples:
- `feat/add-json-output`
- `fix/handle-empty-urls`
- `docs/update-readme`

### Coding Standards

Follow these guidelines to maintain code quality:

#### Go Code Style

- Follow `gofmt` formatting
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write clear comments for public functions
- Keep functions small and focused
- Handle errors appropriately

#### Example:

```go
// ExtractLinks extracts all valid HTTP/HTTPS links from the given HTML content.
// It returns a slice of normalized URLs and any parsing errors encountered.
func ExtractLinks(html string, baseURL *url.URL) ([]string, error) {
    if html == "" {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("empty HTML content")
    }

    // Implementation...
}
```

#### Project Structure

Follow the established project structure:

```
urlmap/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cmd/urlmap/          # CLI application entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ internal/            # Private application code
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ crawler/         # Core crawling logic
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ parser/          # HTML parsing
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pkg/                 # Public libraries
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test/                # Test files and fixtures
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/                # Documentation
```

### Commit Messages

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
<type>: <description>

<body>

<footer>
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding/updating tests
- `ci`: CI/CD changes

Examples:
```
feat: add JSON output format support

Add --output-format flag to support JSON output in addition to
the default plain text format. This enables better integration
with other tools and scripts.

Closes #123
```

```
fix: handle malformed URLs gracefully

Previously, the crawler would panic when encountering malformed
URLs. Now it logs a warning and continues processing.

Fixes #456
```

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run tests with coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Run tests verbosely
go test -v ./...

# Run specific package tests
go test ./internal/crawler/
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Aim for good test coverage (we target 80%+)
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate
- Include both positive and negative test cases

#### Example Test:

```go
func TestNormalizeURL(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name     string
        input    string
        expected string
        wantErr  bool
    }{
        {
            name:     "valid HTTP URL",
            input:    "http://example.com/path",
            expected: "http://example.com/path",
            wantErr:  false,
        },
        {
            name:     "invalid URL",
            input:    "not-a-url",
            expected: "",
            wantErr:  true,
        },
    }

    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            result, err := NormalizeURL(tt.input)
            if (err != nil) != tt.wantErr {
                t.Errorf("NormalizeURL() error = %v, wantErr %v", err, tt.wantErr)
                return
            }
            if result != tt.expected {
                t.Errorf("NormalizeURL() = %v, want %v", result, tt.expected)
            }
        })
    }
}
```

### Integration Tests

Run end-to-end tests to ensure the full application works:

```bash
# Run integration tests
go test ./test/integration/

# Run E2E tests
go test ./test/e2e/
```
